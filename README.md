# To-Do App - React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is a **To-Do List App** built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It supports adding, marking, and deleting tasks with persistence using **localStorage**. The app is styled with **SCSS** and utilises **IBM Carbon Components** for a modern UI design.

## **Features**

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks with a simple input form.
- **Mark as Completed**: Toggle the status of tasks between completed and pending.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persisted Data**: Tasks are saved in **localStorage** and persist across page reloads.
